The Health Intelligence Lab, directed by Professor Yuzhe Yang, works on advancing scalable, multisensory, and generative AI to drive innovations in healthcare, medicine, and scientific discovery.

- **AI for Medicine and Science**: Using AI to accelerate scientific discovery for human health and diseases, as in AI biomarker for Parkinson's disease.  
- **Generalist Health Models**: Building general-purpose multisensory foundation and language models for scalable health intelligence, as in LSM and SensorLM.  
- **Universal Health Intelligence Access**: Making health insights universally and equitably accessible, as in SimPer and deployable medical imaging AI.  
- **Trustworthy Learning Algorithms**: Creating AI that can be reliably deployed in high-stakes applications, as in DIR, MDLT, and SubpopBench.
